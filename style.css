!-- Lesson 2 - HTML/CSS 
Fundamentals 

Now that you have watched us create an HTML file and external style sheet you will do one of your own. 
You will be writing all of your code in 
homework.html found in this folder.
To view your HTML file, in your web browser select File-Open File- then select the homework.html file in this folder.-->
	 <html>
	 <head/> 
	  <title> "Ryan's HTML homework" <title/>
	  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" style.css">
	<body>
   
		<div class= divClass>	 
			<h1 style= 'Blue'> Ryan
 </h1>
			<h3>"Lambda School".
</h3> 
			<h4> "HTML/CSS homework"
 </h4>    
		</div> 
		 <div class= divClass>
			<span id = spanId> My favorite food group is Choclate Eclair Ice Cream <'a'> 

</span>
		</div>	
		 <div = thirdDiv>
			<ul> 
			 <li> <img = "https://www.coldstonecreamery.com/"></li>
			 <li><img = "https://www.coldstonecreamery.com/"</li>
			</ul>

		</div>
		
		III. Create an external style sheet and move all of our previous style rules into the new stylesheet.
  
A. Create a file called styles.css in this folder.
  
B. COPY all of your style rules to this new file. (Do not include the style tags!)
  
C. Place: <!-- in front of your first style tag.
  
D. Place: --> after your closing style tag.
  
E. Add a link tag to your html that imports your new css file. 

		
		
IV. Add, Commit and push your work to your github account.

Extra credit:
   
  
In order to do some of this you will either need to have an understanding of CSS currently, or will need to 
  do some further homework, I recommend the additional resources in the
 README or https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
